## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   pnpm (or npm/yarn if you prefer, but `pnpm-lock.yaml` is provided)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

### Running in Development Mode

To start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:4321`.

### Building for Production

To build the static site for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` directory.

## üìÑ `cv.json`

The portfolio content (personal details, experience, projects, etc.) is primarily managed through the `cv.json` file located in the root directory. Modify this file to update the portfolio information.

## üß™ Testing

Unit tests for JavaScript utility functions (e.g., date formatting, data sorting) are located in `src/utils/` and use a Vitest/Jest-like syntax (e.g., `*.test.js`).

To run tests (conceptual, requires test runner setup like Vitest):
```bash
# pnpm test # Or your configured test script
```

Currently, tests cover:
- `formatDateRange()`: Ensures correct formatting of date ranges for experience and education.
- `sortWorkExperiences()`: Ensures correct chronological sorting of work experiences.
